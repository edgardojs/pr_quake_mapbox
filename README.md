You can freely edit and use the code as long as there is mention of this repo. 

## Working
Fetch data with axios and use mapbox to display the data.

## Possible improvements

Change to hooks
|| Have the markers display on hover
|| Improve CSS (heavily considering replacing semantic UI react)

## PLEASE MAKE YOUR OWN MAPBOX API KEY TO MAKE THIS WORK
Check the [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.mapbox.com/ "mapbox") documentation on how to get your own API key
